  <center><h2>Integration History</h2></center>
  <div class="byline"><center>BY: COLLEEN D. CURRAN</center></div><br></br>

<p>The process of integrating schools in America was lengthy and at times violent. Not until the late 1980s did southern states reach almost full integration with 43.5 percent black students in predominantly white schools.</p>

<p>Many living in northern cities, like Boston, Massachusetts, challenged these mandates and resisted integration for decades. The northeast today is home to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/05/15/the-most-segregated-schools-may-not-be-in-the-states-youd-expect-2/?utm_term=.e8280c9f05e5">most segregated schools in the country.</a></p>

<p>Some scholars argue that schools are re-segregating as a result of legal changes throughout the 1970s and into the early 1990s. Others claim that schools are integrated, but that it is more difficult today to maintain balanced diversification with rapidly changing demographics.</p>

<!--Knightlab slideshow-->

<p>In 1991, the Supreme Court found that district courts could permanently end desegregation injunctions if schools could prove that they were compliant with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This was an important turning point for shool integration.</p>

<p>The integration method of cross-district busing is also no longer mandated. The <a href="https://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/a-multiracial-society-with-segregated-schools-are-we-losing-the-dream/frankenberg-multiracial-society-losing-the-dream.pdf">UCLA Civil Rights Project's</a> research shows that schools with zero to 10 percent white student admission has more than tripled following these changes to desegregation laws.</p>


<!--Table-->
<div>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Shifting Demographics</strong></td>
    <td>Without mandated integration methods, students typically attend their neighborhood schools, which, for many black and Latino students, mean schools in low-income areas with limited supplies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Poverty and Race</strong></td>
    <td>Poor black and Latino students, who live where a high portion of the population is poor - living under the federal poverty line - are more likely to attend a school in that particular area than white students.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Less Opportunities</strong></td>
    <td>Low-income schools offer less AP, IB and other gifted student courses. These schools tend to have more students of color. Moreover, there are more teachers with less than one year teaching experience at low-income schools than a white schools.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>District Limitations</strong></td>
    <td>According to <a href ="http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/segregation-then-now">The Center for Public Education,</a> school segregation today typically takes place between districts, not within districts. It can be challenging to integrate school systems across district lines.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
<!--End Table-->

<p>The way schools and neighborhoods look today is not simply a result of de facto segregation – racism, person to person - but of de jure, legalized and federally supported avenues, like redlining, that segregated and allowed unequal institutions to grow and exists in this country.</p>

  <a name="today"></a><center><h2>Where do we see resegregation today?</h2></center>

<p>Most schools no longer reflect the racial makeup of the country. Even though research proves that better integrated schools lead to improved academic performance for all students, schools today are again isolated by race, and school enrollment is often a product of residential patterns and economic limitations.</p>

<a name="PGC"></a><center><h2>A Local Look: Prince George's County, Maryland</h2></center>

<blockquote>“The final decision of the Supreme Court is now the law of the land and is automatically binding upon the public school system of Maryland and upon the several local school officials throughout the State, and that the State Courts and the Federal Courts, should cases arise, are bound by the decision of the Supreme Court to recognize and give full force and effect thereto.” -Maryland’s Attorney General Edward D. E. Rollins.</blockquote>

<p>School desegregation followed the <em>Brown</em> decision in Maryland. But this federal mandate was met with opponents who fought against busing as well as advocates who argued the state and school systems were dragging their feet in enforcing the constitutional mandate.</p>


<p>Counties in Maryland did not desegregate immediately after the Court's decision, despite the demand for “deliberate speed” in the <em>Brown</em> case. <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210023598079;view=1up;seq=177">The burden</a> was placed on families of color to apply for their children to attend white schools, not the other way around.</p>

<p>County school boards had a lot of power in determining the process of desegregation in Maryland. In Prince George’s County, school choice was subject to available spots and open capacity at most facilities with approval by the board of education.  The board could also “delay or deny” school admission based on the community’s best interest, “public safety and community welfare,” according to the 1956 Civil Rights Commission on school integration in Maryland. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31210023598079;view=1up;seq=7">U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in March 1976</a> chronicled the history, economic makeup and population of PGC; the racial population of schools between 1953 and 1964; the changes in schools from 1965 to 1972; and the commission’s conclusions. The commission staff interviewed students, teachers, parents, administrators, board members and state officials to gather the information. </p>

<blockquote>“Racial segregation in public education – condemned by its opponents as illegal, immoral, inefficient, and un-American – was so established in Prince George’s County, Maryland, that to many people it seemed immutable.”-1976 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</blockquote>

<p> The over 400-page report discussed a law suit in 1972 against the Prince George’s County Board of Education that was brought by eight black parents who argued that the county’s schools were segregated, (<em>Vaughns v. Board of Education of Prince George’s County</em>).</p>

<p>The parents won, and the county was forced to create a plan for desegregation by the second semester of the 1972-1973 academic year. The number of students bused from home to school would now increase from 13,000 to 33,000.</p>

<p>Myriad black students and black parents were heard by this commission, which gave them a platform to express their concerns about the school districts, when the county board of education failed to listen.</p>

<p>But one fourth of public schools in Maryland remain segregated today.  In 2010, the most segregated schools in Prince George’s county were almost 100 percent minority students and also had the highest amount of low-income students (over 70 percent).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/1/8/16822374/school-segregation-gerrymander-map">Vox data sets</a> on nationwide public school population shows that PGC Public Schools create zones not based directly on residential areas to help desegregate schools.  Based on population estimates from July 2017, PGC has predominantly black residents, making up 64.6 percent of the county population, a county that was <a href="https://www-jstor-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/stable/pdf/2963039.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A51d02ff9d019efce3a3df8acd03b7668">predominantly white in the 1970s.</a></p>

UCLA's Civil Rights Project reported that PGC ended 33 <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/magnetschools/">magnet school programs</a> in 2004 as a result of budget cuts, destroying the county’s goal of achieving balanced school integration despite efforts to represent all races and income levels in each school sub-district.</p>
