<div class="introtext"><p><em>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</em> (1954) overturned the separate but equal judgment that <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> legalized in 1896. The Warren court’s landmark decision found that the separate but equal doctrine violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because separate educational facilities for minority students was fundamentally unequal.</p>
<p>There remains some success with Brown’s landmark decision, like southern schools having the least segregated schools in the nation today. But there has been no action equal to that of the mandated integration to further diversify schools throughout the country even as demographics changed overtime. As a result, schools are more segregated today than in the 1970s and 1980s for many reasons.</p>

  <center><strong><h2>Are Schools Resegregating?</h2></strong></center>

  <div class="byline"><center>BY: COLLEEN D. CURRAN</center></div><br></br>
<p>The process of integrating schools in America was lengthy and at times violent. Not until the late 1980s did southern states reached almost full integration with 43.5 percent black students in predominantly white schools.  Many northern cities, like Boston, MA, challenged these mandates and resisted integration for decades. The northeast today is home to the most segregated schools in the country.</p>

<p>Some scholars  argue that schools are re-segregating as a result of legal changes throughout the 1970s and into the early 1990s. Others claim that schools are integrated, but that it’s more difficult today to maintain balanced diversification with rapidly changing demographics.</p>

<br></br>

<p><em>Board of Education of Oklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell</em> is an important turning point that helped determine today’s school resegregation. In a 5-3 decision, the Rehnquist court found that district courts could permanently end desegregation injunctions previously mandated if schools could prove that they were compliant with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>  <p>The integration method of cross-district busing is also no longer mandated. The UCLA Civil Rights Project’s research shows that schools with zero to 10 percent white student admission has more than tripled following changes to mandated desegregation laws.</p>

<p>Today, most schools no longer reflect the racial makeup of the country. Even though research proves that better integrated schools lead to improved academic performance for all students, schools today are again isolated by race, and school enrollment is often a product of residential patterns and economic boundaries.</p><br></br>

<p>More white parents are choosing to enroll their children in private institutions that are not located in their residential districts, which has decreased the percentage of white students in public schools overtime.  Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos, professor of law at the University of Chicago argues that it is now residential makeup that primarily determines where a child will go to school and what the racial and economic makeup of that school will be, unless a parent chooses to enroll their child elsewhere.</p>

<p>The way schools and neighborhoods look today is not simply a result of de facto segregation – of racism, person to person - but of de jure, legalized and federally supported avenues that segregated and allowed racism and racist institutions to grow and exists in this country. Examples of this include the G.I. Bill giving grants to white soldiers upon their return home from fighting abroad during World War II, but not for southern black soldiers. Redlining, which was ended only recently in the 1960s, also limited where families of color could live by blocking their ability to own homes in designated areas. White flight from cities into suburbs also helped create the still segregated neighborhoods that help determine school population by race today.</p><br></br>

<p>MORE INFO NEEDEDhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/02/nyregion/new-study-school-choice-increases-school-segregation.html It's not just residential segregation that's causing school regregregation. In NYC, for example, a recent May 2018 study shows that 40 percent of elementary students in NYC aren't attending their zoned schools. Parents are moving their children to schools that "fewer poor students than the zoned schools the families were leaving, and they had higher test scores," (New York Times link)"</p>

<h4>Prince George's County, Maryland</h4><br></br>

<img src="images/picketers courtsey Smithsonian National Museum of American Histor.jpg" alt="MDPicketers" class= "hero-image"><br></br>
<p>School desegregation followed the Brown decision in Maryland.</p>

<blockquote>“The final decision of the Supreme Court is now the law of the land and is automatically binding upon the public school system of Maryland and upon the several local school officials throughout the State, and that the State Courts and the Federal Courts, should cases arise, are bound by the decision of the Supreme Court to recognize and give full force and effect thereto.” -Maryland’s then Attorney General Edward D. E. Rollins.</blockquote>


<p>But desegregation, like in other states, was met with opponents who fought against busing as well as advocates who argued the state and school systems were dragging their feet in enforcing the constitutional mandate.</p>

<p>In reviewing data from Maryland local officials and school districts, the burden was placed on families of color to apply for their sons and daughters to attend white schools, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Of course, desegregating school districts was a process that took time and organization. But the counties in Maryland did not fully desegregate immediately after the Court's decision, despite the their demand for “deliberate speed” in the Brown case.</p>

<p>The county school boards had a lot of power in determining the process of desegregation in Maryland. In Prince George’s County, school choice was subject to available spots and open capacity at most facilities with approval by the board of education.  The board of education could also “delay or deny” school admission based on the community’s best interest, “public safety and community welfare.” </p><!--Pie Chart 2_PGC Enrollment based on race-->

<p>A United States Commission on Civil Rights in March 1976 called “A Long Day’s Journey into Light: School Segregation in Prince George’s County.” It was an investigation that chronicled the history, economic makeup and residential and population of the county; the racial population of schools between 1953 and 1964; the changes in schools from 1965 to 1972; and the commission’s conclusions. The commission staff interviewed students, teachers, parents, administrators, board members and state officials to gather the information. </p>

<blockquote>“Racial segregation in public education – condemned by its opponents as illegal, immoral, inefficient, and un-American – was so established in Prince George’s County, Maryland, that to many people it seemed immutable.”-1976 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.</blockquote>

<p> The over 400-page report discusses a law suit in 1972 against the Prince George’s County Board of Education that was brought by eight black parents who argued that the county’s schools were segregated, (<em>Vaughns v. Board of Education of Prince George’s County</em>). The parents won, and the county was forced to create a plan for desegregation by the second semester of the 1972-1973 academic year.  The number of students bused from home to school would now increase from 13,000 to 33,000.</p>

<p>According to a 1972 U.S., Department of Health, Education, and Welfare report, the PGC school board allowed all-black and all-white schools to operate despite the constitutional mandate to integrate. The report shows that between 1965 and 1966, “10 schools were all black, 9 were majority black, and 112 schools were 95 percent or more white.” </p>


<br></br><p>insert audio file on maryland equity project</p><br></br>

<p>The mandated school desegregation distributed more materials, giving schools that were previously all-black with more materials and supplies. Myriad black students and black parents were heard by this commission, which gave them a platform to express their concerns about the school districts, when the county board of education failed to hear them before.</p>

<p>But one fourth of public schools in Maryland remain segregated.  In 2010, the most segregated schools in Prince George’s county were almost 100 percent minority students and also had the highest amount of low-income students (over 70 percent). This is known as apartheid schools. </p>

<p>According to a Vox data set that allows you to see the attendance of public schools by race in each county, Prince George’s County Public Schools create zones not based directly on residential areas to help desegregate schools.  Based on population estimates from July 2017, PGC has predominantly black residents, making up 64.6 percent of the county population.</p>


<p>The PGC school board divided the district into three sub-districts when court-ordered desegregation was no longer necessary as of 2002. The sub-districts did a good job representing all races and income levels. Moreover, students had the freedom to choose what school to attend within any of the sub-districts. According to the Civil Rights Project, PGC ended 33 magnet school programs as a result of budget cuts. This destroyed the county’s goal of achieving balanced school integration.</p>


</p>Despite efforts to integrate, like voluntary school desegregation – assigning students to schools based on race – which is now considered illegal following a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Maryland schools will continue to re-segregate overtime.</p>
